Email
======

I can be contacted via email using the following addresses:

* `joanna@invisiblethingslab.com` for ITL- and Qubes-related matters
* `joanna@invisiblethings.org` for other matters

Note on confidentiality
------------------------

Please note that, as most other people and organizations, I use a 3rd party
Mail Service Provider. The stuff who work at the provider is (technically-wise)
able to read all my incoming and outgoing mail. This is by definition of how
email infrastructure work, and it is irrelevant whether SSL or other encryption
is used between email clients and corresponding email servers. If you have
something confidential, please use PGP/GPG encryption to secure our
communication (see [keys.md](/keys/) for info how to obtain and verify my GPG
keys).

Note on integrity of my emails
-------------------------------

All email sent by me from the above-mentioned email addresses should be
digitally signed with my email [keys](/keys/).

A notable exception is Qubes and other mailing lists hosted on Google Groups --
recently Google has implemented logic that rewrites parts of the messages by
adding info on how to unsubscribe from a given ML. That, unfortunately, breaks
any attached digital signatures to the messages, of course.


Other notes on emailing me
---------------------------

* I get lots of emails. This means I might not find time to respond to your
email. In some cases, although rarely, I might not read through the whole
message. Please understand that I would also like to have life outside of my
email VM...

* Please do not write to me personally asking questions about Qubes OS --
instead, please write to one of [our mailing
lists](https://wiki.qubes-os.org/wiki/QubesLists).

* I can only read email in English or Polish.

* Please don't write asking me for advise about how to become a "hacker", or
"security researcher".

* I strongly prefer plaintext emails. If you send me an HTML-formatted message I
will still be viewing it as plaintext, and so I might be missing on some of the
extra information you put there, such as markings done with differently colored
fonts, etc.


Phone, Skype, etc.
===================

I don't believe phone (or similar means of communication) are that great for
technical discussions. My experience shows that phone-based conversations lack
technical depth, and are prone to misunderstandings, especially pronounced when
talking over VoIP connection across the Atlantic. Additionally, they require
fixed time slots allocations, suitable for both parties, which is generally a
PITA. In most cases discussions are clearer, faster, and more comfortable using
email! Not to mention they could be much more secure if GPG is used also.

That being said, I'm available for scheduled phone or conference calls. Please
notice that I live in Warsaw, Poland, which is in UTC +1 (Winter) and UTC +2
(Summer) Time Zone. I'm a late sleeper, and usually cannot do a phone call
before 1100 hrs of my local time.

Note on Skype
--------------

As a matter of principle I don't use Skype. It's not because Skype does not
offer any meaningful security or privacy (which I believe it indeed does not
offer) -- I have no illusions that other global PSTN or cellular telephony does
not offer it either. It's rather because Skype is a closed communication system
based on a [proprietary protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype_protocol).

We should be discouraging businesses and governments from forcing us into
closed systems. Imagine a road system that allowed only one select make of cars
to be driven -- would that be fun?


Public conversations
=====================

It is also possible to engage with me in public conversations via:

* [My Twitter account](https://twitter.com/rootkovska/)
* [Qubes Mailing Lists](https://wiki.qubes-os.org/wiki/QubesLists) (especially on `qubes-devel` ML)

Policy on LinkedIn
===================

I don't use LinkedIn anymore, I have deleted my account some time ago. The
stream of invites from total strangers, inability to verify trust, all makes
LinkedIn and similar platforms rather meaningless, IMO.

Please do not send me LinkedIn or similar invites. These will be reported as
spam.
