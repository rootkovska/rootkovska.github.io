This page (hopefully) contains some useful information for conference organizers
who wish to invite me to speak at their event, such as the current biography &
photo to be used for the conference page, as well as a few technical
requirements/constraints for travel and food.

Bio
----

Joanna Rutkowska is a founder of Invisible Things Lab and the Qubes OS project,
which she has been leading since its inception in 2010. Prior to that she has
been focusing on system-level offensive security research. Together with her
team at ITL, she has presented numerous attacks on virtualization systems and
Intel security technologies, including the famous series of exploits against the
Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT), the still-only-one software attack
demonstrating Intel VT-d escape, and also supervised her team with the
pioneering research on breaking into the Intel vPro BIOS and AMT/MT technology.
She is also known for writing Blue Pill, the first hardware virtualization-based
rootkit, introducing Evil Maid attack, and for her prior work on kernel-mode
malware for Windows and Linux in the first half of the 2000s.

Travel requirements
--------------------

1. For any segment that requires more than 4 hours on a plane, I would require a
   business class ticket. There is absolutely no exception from this rule,
   sorry.

Dietary constraints
-------------------

1. I'm a vegetarian. I eat eggs and dairy though.
2. I enjoy mostly European cuisines (mostly southern).
3. I don't tolerate anything spicy, sour, and generally don't like anything
   exotic (in the meaning: different than European food)

Other constraints
-----------------

1. As a matter of principle, I don't travel to countries whose official laws
   are in stark contrast with my personal beliefs and values. This includes
   e.g.  all the countries that de-recognize women's rights _by law_ (such as
   most of the Arabic countries), de-legalize love (such as, incredible and
   sad to believe, Russia today), or otherwise limit people's freedom in some
   unacceptable way. To be clear: it is absolutely irrelevant whether I
   personally would be subject to any risk due to such discriminatory laws or
   not.


Tips & Tricks
--------------

1. Please don't ask me "how did you start with computers and security" -- as you
   might imagine I have been asked this question about 1 million times
   already, and so I hardly enjoy repeating the answer yet one more time. There
   are certainly more interesting topics to discuss!

2. Please don't ask me how I like the place I'm just visiting -- if I liked it
   I would sure to mention it by myself. Most of the time though, when
   traveling for business, I don't have enough time to get any opinion, and
   I'm not quite the kind of person who would say "Oh, it's great!" just to
   please you, sorry.

3. Don't ask me to help with your IT security career or to scan your laptop for
   malware, or how to implement advanced OpSec ;)

4. I won't be insulted if you don't express excitement about my presentation,
   last paper, or current project ;)

5. Don't make it look like I'm being invited to speak because I'm a woman. In
   that case I will likely turn down your invitation.

6. My name is pronounced: root-kov-skea

Thanks for your understanding!
