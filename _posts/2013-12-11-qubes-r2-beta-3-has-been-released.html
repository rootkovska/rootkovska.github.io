<style type="text/css">P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }A:link {  }</style>  <br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Today we're releasing Qubes R2 Beta 3, one of the latest milestones on our roadmap for Qubes R2. Even though it is still called a “beta”, most users should install it, because, we believe, it is the most polished and stable Qubes edition. Looking back, I think it was a mistake to use this alpha/beta/rc nomenclature to mark Qubes releases, and so, starting with Qubes R3 we will be just using version numbers: 3.0, 3.1, etc.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Anyway, back to the R2 Beta 3 – below I discuss some of the highlights of the today's release:</div><ul><li><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The <b>seamless GUI virtualization  for Windows 7-based AppVMs</b>, and support for <b>HVM-based  templates </b>(e.g. Windows-based templates) is one of the most  spectacular feature of this release, I think. It has already been  discussed in an <a href="/2013/11/26/windows-7-seamless-gui-integration.html">earlier blog post</a>,  and now instructions have also been added <a href="http://wiki.qubes-os.org/trac/wiki/WindowsAppVms">to the wiki</a> for how to install and use such Windows AppVMs.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div></li><li><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We've also introduced a much more  <b>advanced infrastructure for system backups</b>, so it is now  possible to make and restore backups to/from <i>untrusted </i><span style="font-style: normal;">VMs,  which allows e.g. to backup easily the whole system to a NAS, or  just to an USB device, not worrying that somebody might  exploit the NAS client over the network, or that plugging of the USB disk </span><span style="font-style: normal;">with  malformed partition table or filesystem </span><span style="font-style: normal;">might  compromise the system. The whole point here is that the VM that  handles the backup storage (and which might be directing it to a  NAS, or somewhere) might be compromised, and it still cannot do  anything that could compromise (or even DoS) the system, neither can  it sniff the data in the backup. I will write more about the  challenges we had to solve and how we did it in a separate blog  post. I'm very proud to note that majority of the implementation for  this has been contributed by the community, specifically Oliver  Medoc. </span><span style="font-style: normal;">Thanks!</span></div></li></ul><ul><li><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-style: normal;">A  very simple feature, trivial almost, yet very important from the  security point of view – it is now possible to set </span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>'autostart'  property on select VMs</b></span><span style="font-style: normal;">.  Why is this so important for security? Because I can create e.g.  UsbVM, assign all my USB controllers to it, and then once I set it  as autostarting, I can have assurance that all my USB controllers  will be delegated to such AppVM immediately upon each system boot.  Having such a UsbVM is a very good idea, if one is afraid of  physical <span id="goog_20988535"></span><a href="http://www.blogger.com/goog_20988534">attacks coming though USB devices</a></span><a href="http://www.blogger.com/"><span style="font-style: normal;"></span></a><span style="font-style: normal;"><span id="goog_20988536"></span>.  And it now could double as a BackupVM with this new backup system  mentioned above!</span></div></li></ul><ul><li><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-style: normal;">To  improve hardware compatibility we now ship the installer with  </span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>multiple </b></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>kernel  versions </b></span><span style="font-style: normal;">(3.7, 3.9, and  3.11) allowing to run the installation using any of those, e.g. if  it turned out that one kernel doesn't support the graphics card  correctly -- a typical problem many users faced in the past. All the kernels are also installed in the final system, allowing the user to easily boot with a select Dom0 kernel later, choosing the one which supports their hardware best. </span></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div></li><li><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-style: normal;">Another popular problem of the past now was the lack of support for dynamically changing resolution/screen layout in the AppVMs when a seccond</span><sup><span style="font-style: normal;"></span></sup><span style="font-style: normal;"> monitor or a projector was hot-plugged in (which changed only the resolution layout in  Dom0). Now this problem has been solved and the </span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>new  monitor layout is dynamically propagated to the AppVMs</b></span><span style="font-style: normal;">,  allowing to use all the screen real estate by the apps running there.</span></div></li></ul><ul><li><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">There has also been a significant  amount of <b>cleanups </b><b>and fixes</b>. This includes the  unification of paths and command names (“The Underscore  Revolution” as we call it), as well as refactoring of all the  source code components (which now closely matches what we have on  Qubes Odyssey/R3), and lots of various bugfixes.</div></li></ul><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We're planning one more release (Qubes R2 RC1) before the final R2, which will bring improvements mostly in the area of more polished UI, such as allowing some of the tasks that currently require commandline to be done from the Qubes Manager. So, this would mostly be a minor cosmetic upgrade, plus bugfixes. And probably we will also upgrade the default Linux template to Fedora 20.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Installation and upgrade instructions can be found <a href="http://wiki.qubes-os.org/trac/wiki/QubesDownloads">here</a>.</div>
