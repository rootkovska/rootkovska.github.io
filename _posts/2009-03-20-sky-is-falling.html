A few reporters asked me if our <a href="http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2009/03/attacking-smm-memory-via-intel-cpu.html">recent paper on SMM attacking</a> via CPU cache poisoning means the sky is really falling now?<br /><br />Interestingly, not many people seem to have noticed that this is the 3rd attack against SMM our team has found in the last 10 months. OMG :o<br /><br />But anyway, does the fact we can easily compromise the SMM today, and write SMM-based malware, does that mean the sky is falling for the average computer user?<br /><br />No! The sky has actually fallen many years ago… Default users with admin privileges, monolithic kernels everywhere, most software unsigned and downloadable over plaintext HTTP — these are the main reasons we cannot trust our systems today.  And those pathetic attempts to fix it, e.g. via restricting admin users on Vista, but still requiring full admin rights to install any piece of stupid software. Or selling people illusion of security via A/V programs, that cannot even protect themselves properly…<br /><br />It's also funny how so many people focus on solving the security problems by <a href="http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2008/09/three-approaches-to-computer-security.html">"Security by Correctness" or "Security by Obscurity"</a>  approaches — patches, patches, NX and ASLR — all good, but it is not gonna work as an ultimate protection (if it could, it would worked out already).<br /><br />On the other hand, there are some emerging technologies out there that could allow us to implement effective <a href="http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2008/09/three-approaches-to-computer-security.html">"Security by Isolation"</a> approach. Such technologies as VT-x/AMD-V, VT-d/IOMMU or Intel TXT and TPM.<br /><br />So we, at ITL, <a href="http://invisiblethingslab.com/itl/Resources.html">focus on</a> analyzing those new technologies, even though almost nobody uses them today. Because those technologies could actually make the difference. Unlike A/V programs or Patch Tuesdays, those technologies can change the level of sophistication required for the attacker dramatically.<br /><br />The attacks we focus on are important for those new technologies — e.g. today Intel TXT is pretty much useless without protection from SMM attacks. And currently there is no such protection, which sucks. SMM rootkits sound sexy, but, frankly, the bad guys are doing just fine using traditional kernel mode malware (due to the fact that A/V is not effective). Of course, SMM rootkits are just yet another annoyance for the traditional A/V programs, which is good, but they might not be the most important consequence of SMM attacks.<br /><br />So, should the average Joe Dow care about our SMM attacks? Absolutely not!
