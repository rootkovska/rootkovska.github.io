The work on Qubes OS has been extremely exciting and also very challenging for us. While most of the work we have been doing so far relates to solving various technical, under-the-hood challenges, the more important goals in the long-term are related more to mitigating the so called "human factor", i.e. making the system not only easy to use, but tolerant to user absentmindedness. This includes e.g. ensuring the user uses a correct AppVM (e.g. do the banking in the "banking" AppVM, and not in the "random web browsing" AppVM, and also not the other way around: don't do random surfing in the "banking" AppVM), and generally making the whole isolation between AppVMs as seamless as possible, but without sacrificing the security at the same time. <br /><br />This is becoming very important, as the technical level of security in Qubes is already very high, and so the "human factor" might easily become a low hanging fruit for the attacker. (<a href="/2007/04/01/human-factor.html">In contrast to other OSes</a>) <br /><br />But for Qubes to become something more than just an interesting OS for Linux geeks and security enthusiasts, it is also critical to have better application support. Right now Qubes lets users run Linux apps, because each AppVM is Linux-based. But, and let's not be afraid to admit this: Linux sucks when it comes to application support! (Take Open Office as an example - it not only looks like MS Office 97, but is also terribly user-unfriendly, especially their presentation program, the Impress. Why is it so difficult to make it look and behave more like Apple Keynote?)<br /><br />There is only one way to provide better application support to Qubes: make it support Windows-based, or Mac-based, AppVMs. Just imagine that: being able to run most of your Windows (or Mac) applications, but at the same time benefit from the Qubes strong isolation and seamless integration on one common desktop...<br /><br />In order to implement support for Windows-based AppVMs (or alternatively Mac-based AppVM) we would need to engage significant resources (5+ very skilled developers, working full time for 1+ year), and so we're currently looking for an investor that would be able to provide funding for such an endeavor. The idea is to create a dedicated spin-off company that would focus entirely on Qubes and Qubes Pro, and in the future will make a profit from selling Qubes Pro licenses. Qubes Pro will become a commercial product, still based on the open source Qubes, but adding support for Windows-based or Mac-based AppVMs. I would be happy to discuss the details and business plan via email with interested potential investors.<br /><br />Speaking about the future of Qubes: next week I will speak at the European Trusted Infrastructure Summer School, where I will talk about some general stuff like why we need secure desktop systems and why trusted computing might be a way to go, but will also dive a little bit into some new things we plan for Qubes 2.0, such as storage domain and split I/O graphics model. The conference features some very reputable speakers in system-level security field, such as David Grawrock (the father of Intel TXT and TPM), and Loic Duflot (our venerable competitor in the filed of offensive system-level research), so I consider a honour to deliver an opening keynote there (Check the agenda <a href="http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/etiss/agenda">here</a>). <br /><br />I will have my Qubes laptop with me, of course, so if anybody is interested to see Qubes OS live (including Disposable VMs!), I would be happy to do a quick demo on the spot.
