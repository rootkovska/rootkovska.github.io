The Qubes OS project has been around for nearly 8 years now, since its [original
announcement][initial_annoucement] back in April 2010 (and the actual origin
date can be traced back to November 11th, 2009, when an initial email
introducing this project was sent within ITL internally). Over these years Qubes
has achieved reasonable success: according to our estimates, it [has][stats]
nearly 30k regular users. This could even be considered a great success given
that 1) it is a new _operating system_, rather than an _application_ that can be
installed in the user's favorite OS; 2) it has introduced a (radically?) [new
approach][qubes_intro] to managing one's digital life (i.e. an explicit
partitioning model into security domains); and last but not least, 3) it has
very [_specific_ hardware requirements][hcl], which is the result of using Xen
as the hypervisor and Linux-based Virtual Machines (VMs) for networking and USB
qubes. (The term "qube" refers to a compartment -- not necessarily a VM --
inside a Qubes OS system. We'll explain this in more detail below.)

For the past several years, we've been working hard to bring you [Qubes
4.0][qubes40], which features state-of-the-art technology not seen in previous
Qubes versions, notably the next generation [Qubes Core Stack][core3_intro] and
our unique [Admin API][admin_api]. We believe this new platform (Qubes 4
represents a major rewrite of the previous Qubes codebase!) paves the way to
solving many of the obstacles mentioned above.

The new, flexible architecture of Qubes 4 will also open up new possibilities,
and we've recently been thinking about how Qubes OS should evolve in the long
term. In this article, I discuss this vision, which we call Qubes Air. It should
be noted that what I describe in this article has not been implemented yet.

## Why?

Before we take a look at the long-term vision, it might be helpful to understand
why we would like the Qubes architecture to further evolve. Let us quickly recap
some of the most important current weaknesses of Qubes OS (including Qubes 4.0).

### Deployment cost (aka "How do I find a Qubes-compatible laptop?")

Probably the biggest current problem with Qubes OS -- a problem that prevents
its wider adoption -- is the difficulty of finding a compatible laptop on which
to install it. Then, the whole process of needing to install a new _operating
system_, rather than just adding a new _application_, scares many people away.
It's hard to be surprised by that.

This problem of deployment is not limited to Qubes OS, by the way.  It's just
that, in the case of Qubes OS, these problems are significantly more pronounced
due to the aggressive use of virtualization technology to isolate not just apps,
but also devices, as well as incompatibilities between Linux drivers and modern
hardware. (While these driver issues are not inherent to the architecture of
Qubes OS, they affected us nonetheless, since we use Linux-based VMs to handle
devices.)

### The hypervisor as a single point of failure

Since the beginning, we've relied on virtualization technology to isolate
individual qubes from one another. However, this has led to the problem of
over-dependence on the hypervisor. In recent years, as more and more top notch
researchers have begun scrutinizing Xen, a number of [security bugs][xen_bugs]
have been discovered. While [many][qubes_xsa_tracker] of them did not affect the
security of Qubes OS, there were still too many that did. :(

Potential Xen bugs present just one, though arguably the most serious, security
problem. Other problems arise from the underlying architecture of the x86
platform, where various inter-VM side- and covert-channels are made possible
thanks to the aggressively optimized multi-core CPU architecture, most
spectacularly demonstrated by the recently published [Meltdown and Spectre
attacks][meltdown]. Fundamental problems in other areas of the underlying
hardware have also been discovered, such as the [Row Hammer Attack][rowhammer].

This leads us to a conclusion that, at least for some applications, we would
like to be able to achieve better isolation than currently available hypervisors
_and_ commodity hardware can provide.

## How?

As crazy as it might sound at first, one possible solution to these problems is
actually to "move Qubes to the cloud." Don't worry, though. Readers who are
allergic to the notion of having their private computations running in the
(untrusted) cloud should not give up reading just yet. Rest assured that we will
also discuss other solutions not involving the cloud. The beauty of Qubes Air,
we believe, lies in the fact that all these solutions are largely isomorphic,
from both an architecture and code point of view.

## Example: Qubes in the cloud

Let's start with one critical need that many of our customers have expressed:
Can we have "Qubes in the Cloud"?

As I've emphasized over the years, the essence of Qubes does not rest in the Xen
hypervisor, or even in the simple notion of "isolation," but rather in the
[secure decomposition][qubes_separation] of various workflows, devices, apps
across a system of compartments.  Right now, these are mostly desktop workflows,
and the compartments just happen to be implemented as Xen VMs, but neither of
these aspects is essential to the nature of Qubes.  Consequently, we can easily
imagine Qubes running on top of VMs that are hosted in some cloud, such as
Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure, or Google Compute Engine. This is illustrated (in a
very simplified way) in the diagram below:

[![Simplified Qubes-as-a-Service scenario](/attachment/wiki/posts/qubes-cloud.png)](/attachment/wiki/posts/qubes-cloud.png)

It should be clear that such a setup automatically eliminates the deployment
problem discussed above, as the user is no longer expected to perform any
installation steps herself. Instead, she can access Qubes-as-a-Service with just
a Web browser or a mobile app. This approach may trade security for convenience
(if the endpoint device used to access Qubes-as-a-Service is insufficiently
protected) or privacy for convenience (if the cloud operator is not trusted).
For many use cases, however, the ability to access Qubes from any device and any
location makes the trade-off well worth it.

We said above that we can imagine "Qubes running on top of VMs" in some cloud,
but what exactly does that mean?

First and foremost, we'd want the [Qubes Core Stack][core3_intro] connected to
that cloud's management API, so that whenever the user executes, say,
`qvm-create` (or, more generally, issues any [Admin API][admin_api] call, in
this case `admin.vm.Create.*`) a new VM gets created and properly connected in
the Qubes infrastructure.

This means that most (all?) Qubes Apps (e.g. Split GPG, PDF and image
converters, and many more), which are built around qrexec, should Just Work (TM)
when run inside a Qubes-as-a-Service setup.

Now, what about the Admin and GUI domains? Where would they go in a
Qubes-as-a-Service scenario? This is an important question, and the answer is
much less obvious. We'll return to it below. First, let's look at a couple more
examples that demonstrate how Qubes Air could be implemented.

## Example: Hybrid Mode

Some users might decide to run a subset of their qubes (perhaps some personal
ones) on their local laptops, while using the cloud only for other, less
sensitive VMs.  In addition to privacy, another bonus of running some of the VMs
locally would be much lower GUI latency.

The ability to run some VMs locally and some in the cloud is what I refer to as
_Hybrid Mode_. The beauty of Hybrid Mode is that the user doesn't even have to
be aware (unless specifically interested!) in whether a particular VM is running
locally or in the cloud. The Admin API, qrexec services, and even the GUI,
should all automatically handle both cases. Here's an example of a Hybrid Mode
configuration:

[![Qubes hybrid scenario](/attachment/wiki/posts/qubes-cloud-hybrid.png)](/attachment/wiki/posts/qubes-cloud-hybrid.png)

Another benefit of Hybrid Mode is that it can be used to host VMs across several
different cloud providers, not just one. This allows us to solve the problem of
over-dependence on a single isolation technology, e.g. on one specific
hypervisor. Now, if a fatal security bug is discovered that affects one of the
cloud services hosting a group of our VMs, the vulnerability will not
automatically affect the security of our other groups of VMs, since the other
groups may be hosted on different cloud services, or not in the cloud at all.
Crucially, different groups of VMs may be run on different underlying
containerization technologies and different hardware, allowing us to diversify
our risk exposure against any single class of attack.

## Example: Qubes on "air-gapped" devices

This approach even allows us to host each qube (or groups of them) on a
physically distinct computer (connected by something like an Ethernet link),
such as a Raspberry PI or [USB Armory][usbarmory]. Despite the fact that these
are physically separate devices, the Admin API calls, qrexec services, and even
GUI virtualization should all work seamlessly across these qubes!

[![Qubes with some qubes running on "air-gapped" devices](/attachment/wiki/posts/qubes-airgap.png)](/attachment/wiki/posts/qubes-airgap.png)

For some users, it may be particularly appealing to host one's [Split GPG
backend][SplitGPG] or password manager on a physically separate qube. Of course,
it should also be possible to run normal GUI-based apps, such office suites, if
one wants to dedicate a physically separate qube to work on a sensitive project.
The interested reader may find further inspiration in [this
paper][qubes_separation].

The ability to host qubes on distinct physical devices of radically different
kinds opens up numerous possibilities for working around the security problems
with hypervisors and processors we face today.

## Under the hood: Qubes Zones

We've been thinking about what changes to the current Qubes architecture,
especially to the [Qubes Core Stack][core3_intro], would be necessary to make
the scenarios outlined above easy (and elegant) to implement.

There is one important new concept that should make it possible to support all
these scenarios with a unified architecture. We've named it **Qubes Zones**.

A **Zone** is a concept that combines several things together:

 - An underlying "isolation technology" used to implement qubes, which may or
   may not be VMs. For example, they could be Raspberry PIs, USB Armory devices,
   Amazon EC2 VMs, or Docker containers.

 - The inter-qube communication technology. In the case of qubes implemented as
   Xen-based VMs (as in existing Qubes OS releases), the Xen-specific shared
   memory mechanism (so called Grant Tables) is used to implement the
   communication between qubes. In the case of Raspberry PIs, Ethernet
   technology would likely be used. In the case of Qubes running in the cloud,
   some form of cloud-provided networking would provide inter-qube
   communication.  Technically speaking, this is about how Qubes' vchan would be
   implemented, as the qrexec layer should remain the same across all possible
   platforms.

 - A "local copy" of an _Admin qube_ (previously referred to as the "AdminVM"),
   used mainly to orchestrate VMs and make policing decisions for all the qubes
   within the Zone. This Admin qube can be in either "Master" or "Slave" mode,
   and there can only be one Admin qube running as Master across all the Zones
   in _one Qubes system_.

 - Optionally, a "local copy" of _GUI qube_ (previously referred to as the "GUI
   domain" or "GUIVM"). As with the Admin qube, the GUI qube runs in either
   Master or Slave mode. The user is expected to connect (e.g. with the RDP
   protocol) or log into the GUI qube that runs in Master mode (and only that
   one), which has the job of combining all the GUI elements exposed via the
   other GUI qubes (all of which must run in Slave mode).

 - Some technology to implement storage for the qubes running within the Zone.
   In the case of Qubes OS running Xen, the local disk is used to store VM
   images (more specifically, in Qubes 4.0 we use [Storage
   Pools][qubes_storage_pool] by default). In the case of a Zone composed of a
   cluster of Raspberry PIs or similar devices, the storage could be a bunch of
   micro-SD cards (each plugged into one Raspberry PI) or some kind of network
   storage.

[![Qubes Zones is the key new concept for Qubes Air](/attachment/wiki/posts/qubes-zones.png)](/attachment/wiki/posts/qubes-zones.png)

So far, this is nothing radically new compared to what we already have in Qubes
OS, especially since we have nearly completed our effort to abstract the Qubes
architecture away from Xen-specific details -- an effort we code-named [_Qubes
Odyssey_][qubes_odyssey].

What _is_ radically different is that we now want to allow more than one Zone to
exist in a single Qubes system!

In order to support multiple Zones, we have to provide transparent proxying of
qrexec services across Zones, so that a qube need not be aware that another qube
from which it requests a service resides in a different zone.  This is the main
reason we've introduce multiple "local" Admin qubes --one for each Zone.  Slave
Admin qubes are bridges that allow the Master Admin qube to manage the whole
system (e.g. request the creation of new qubes, connect and set up storage for
qubes, and set up networking between qubes).

## Under the hood: qubes' interfaces

Within one Zone, there are multiple _qubes_. Let me stress that the term "qube"
is very generic and does not imply any specific technology. It could be a VM
under _some_ virtualization system. It could be some kind of a container or a
physically separate computing device, such as a Raspberry PI, Arduino board, or
similar device.

While a qube can be implemented in many different ways, there are certain
features it should have:

 1. A qube should implement a [vchan endpoint][vchan]. The actual technology on
    top of which this will be implemented -- whether some shared memory within a
    virtualization or containerization system, TCP/IP, or [something
    else](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1149) -- will be specific to the kind
    of Zone it occupies.

 2. A qube should implement a [qrexec] endpoint, though this should be very
    straightforward if a vchan endpoint has already been implemented. This
    ensures that most (all?) the qrexec services, which are the basis for most
    of the integration, apps, and services we have created for Qubes, should
    Just Work(TM).

 3. Optionally, for some qubes, a GUI endpoint should also be implemented (see
    the discussion below).
 
 4. In order to be compatible with Qubes [networking], a qube should expect
    _one_ uplink network interface (to be exposed by the management technology
    specific to that particular Zone), and (optionally) multiple downlink
    network interfaces (if it is to work as a proxy qube, e.g. VPN or
    firewalling qube).

 5. Finally, a qube should expect two kinds of volumes to be exposed by the
    Zone-specific management stack:
     - one read-only, which is intended to be used as a root filesystem by the
       qube (the management stack might also expose an auxiliary volume for
       implementing copy-on-write illusion for the VM, like the `volatile.img`
       we currently expose on Qubes),
     - and one read-writable, which is specific to this qube, and which is
       intended to be used as home directory-like storage. This is, naturally,
       to allow the implementation of Qubes [templates], a mechanism that we
       believe brings not only a lot of convenience but also some [security
       benefits][paranoid_backups].

## GUI virtualization considerations

Since [the very beginning][qubes_arch], Qubes was envisioned as a system for
desktop computing (as opposed to servers). This implied that [GUI
virtualization][qubes_gui] was part of the core Qubes infrastructure.

However, with some of the _security-optimized_ management infrastructure we have
recently added to Qubes OS, i.e. [Salt stack integration][qubes_salt] (which
significantly shrinks the attack surface on the system TCB compared to more
traditional "management" solutions), the [Qubes Admin API][admin_api] (which
allows for the fine-grained decomposition of management roles), and deeply
integrated features such as [templates], we think Qubes Air may also be useful
in some non-desktop applications, such as the embedded appliance space, and
possibly even on the server/services side. In this case, it makes perfect sense
to have qubes not implement GUI protocol endpoints.

However, I still think that the primary area where Qubes excels is in securing
desktop workflows. For these, we need GUI ~~virtualization~~multiplexing, and
the qubes need to implement GUI protocol endpoints. Below, we discuss some of
the trade-offs involved here.

The Qubes [GUI protocol][qubes_gui] is optimized for security. This means that
the protocol is designed to be extremely simple, allowing only for very simple
processing on incoming packets, thus significantly limiting the attack surface
on the GUI daemon (which is usually considered trusted). The price we pay for
this security is the lack of various optimizations, such as on-the-fly
compression, which others protocols, such as VNC and RDP, naturally offer. So
far, we've been able to get away with these trade-offs, because in current Qubes
releases the GUI protocol runs over Xen shared memory. DRAM is very fast (i.e
has low latency and super-high bandwidth), and the implementation on Xen smartly
makes use of page _sharing_ rather than memory _copying_, so that it achieves
near native speed (of course with the limitation that we don't expose GPU
functionalities to VMs, which might limit the experience in some graphical
applications anyway).

However, when qubes run on remote computers (e.g in the cloud) or on physically
separate computers (e.g. on a cluster of Raspberry PIs), we face the potential
problem of graphics performance. The solution we see is to introduce a local
copy of the GUI qube into each zone. Here, we make the assumption that there
should be a significantly faster communication channel available between qubes
within a Zone than between Zones.  For example, inter-VM communication within
one data center should be significantly faster than between the user's laptop
and the cloud. The Qubes GUI protocol is then used between qubes and the local
GUI qube within a single zone, but a more efficient (and more complex) protocol
is used to aggregate the GUI into the Master GUI qube from all the Slave GUI
qubes.  Thanks to this combined setup, we still get the benefit of a reasonably
secure GUI. Untrusted qubes still use the Qubes secure GUI protocol to
communicate with the local GUI qube. However, we also benefit from the greater
efficiency of remote access-optimized protocols such as RDP and VNC to get the
GUI onto the user's device over the network. (Here, we make the assumption that
the Slave GUI qubes are significantly more trustworthy than other
non-privileged qubes in the Zone. If that's not the case, _and_ if we're also
worried about an attacker who has compromised a Slave GUI qube to exploit a
potential bug in the VNC or RDP protocol in order to attack the Master GUI
qube, we could still resort to the fine-grained Qubes Admin API to limit the
potential damage the attacker might inflict.)

## Digression on the "cloudification" of apps

It's hard not to notice how the model of desktop applications has changed over
the past decade or so, where many standalone applications that previously ran on
desktop computers now run in the cloud and have only their frontends executed in
a browser running on the client system. How does the Qubes compartmentalization
model, and more importantly Qubes as a _desktop_ OS, deal with this change?

Above, we discussed how it's possible to move Qubes VMs from the user's local
machine to the cloud (or to physically separate computers) without the user
having to notice. I think it will be a great milestone when we finally get
there, as it will open up many new applications, as well as remove many
obstacles that today prevent the easy deployment of Qubes OS (such as the need
to find and maintain dedicated hardware).

However, it's important to ask ourselves how relevant this model will be in the
coming years. Even with our new approach, we're still talking about classic
standalone desktop applications running in qubes, while the rest of the world
seems to be moving toward an app-as-a-service model in which everything is
hosted in the cloud (e.g. Google Docs and Microsoft Office 365).  How relevant
is the whole Qubes architecture, even the cloud-based version, in the
app-as-a-service model?

I'd like to argue that the Qubes architecture still makes perfect sense in this
new model.

First, it's probably easy to accept that there will always be payloads (i.e.
applications) that users, both individual and corporate, will prefer (or be
forced) to run locally, or at least on trusted servers (clouds). At the same
time, it's very likely that these same users will want to embrace the general,
public cloud with its multitude of app-as-a-service options. Not surprisingly,
there will be a need for isolating these workloads from interfering with each
other.

Some examples of payloads that are better suited as traditional, local
applications (and consequently within qubes), are MS Office for sensitive
documents, large data-processing applications, and networking and USB drivers
and stacks. The latter things may not be very visible to the user, but we can't
really offload them to the cloud. We have to host them on the local machine, and
they present a huge attack surface that jeopardizes the user's other data and
applications.

What about isolating web apps from each other, as well as protecting the host
from them? Of course, that's the primary task of the Web browser. Yet, despite
vendors' best efforts, browser security measures are still being circumvented.
Continued expansion of the APIs that modern browsers expose to Web applications,
such as [WebGL][webgl], suggests that this state of affairs may not
significantly improve in the foreseeable future.

What makes the Qubes model especially useful, I think, is that it allows us to
put the whole browser in a container that is isolated by stronger mechanisms
(simply because Qubes does not have to maintain all the interfaces that the
browser must) and is managed by Qubes-defined policies. It's rather natural to
imagine, e.g. a Chrome OS-based template for Qubes (perhaps even a
unikernel-based one), from which lightweight browser VMs could be created,
either on the user's local machine, or in the cloud, as described above. Again,
there will be pros and cons to both approaches, but Qubes should support both --
and mostly seamlessly from the user's and admin's points of view (as well the
Qubes service developer's point of view!).

## Summary

Qubes Air is the next step on our roadmap to making the concept of "Security
through Compartmentalization" applicable to more scenarios. It is also an
attempt to address some of the biggest problems and weaknesses plaguing the
current implementation of Qubes, specifically the difficulty of deployment and
virtualization as a single point of failure. While Qubes-as-a-Service is one
natural application that could be built on top of Qubes Air, it is certainly not
the only one. We have also discussed running Qubes over clusters of physically
isolated devices, as well as various hybrid scenarios. I believe the approach to
security that Qubes has been implementing for years will continue to be valid
for years to come, even in a world of apps-as-a-service.
