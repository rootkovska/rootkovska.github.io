If you think SMM rootkits or PCI backdoors is low-level, then you should certainly see our talks in Vegas — ITL is going to define what does the "low-level" adjective really mean at the end of the decade ;)<br /><br />In case you haven't noticed it at the <a href="http://blackhat.com/html/bh-usa-09/bh-usa-09-schedule.html">Black Hat website</a> yet — Alex and Rafal will be giving two presentations in Vegas:<br /><br />1) Introducing Ring -3 Rootkits (<a href="http://blackhat.com/html/bh-usa-09/bh-usa-09-speakers.html#Tereshkin">description</a>)<br /><br />2) Attacking Intel® BIOS (<a href="http://blackhat.com/html/bh-usa-09/bh-usa-09-speakers.html#Wojtczuk">description</a>)<br /><br />Let me stress that we have been in touch with Intel for quite some time about the above attacks, and that Intel is planning to release appropriate fixes a few weeks before our presentations at Black Hat.<br /><br />There is more than just this coming at this year's Black Hat — most notably we will also be debuting with our <a href="http://blackhat.com/html/bh-usa-09/train-bh-usa-09-jrk-virt.html">Virtualization (In)Security Training</a>. I will write a separate post about this training (containing a detailed agenda) in the coming days, so stay tuned.<br /><br />Quite exciting.
