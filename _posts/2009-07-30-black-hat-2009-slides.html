The wait is over. The slides are <a href="http://invisiblethingslab.com/itl/Resources.html">here</a>. The press release is <a href="http://invisiblethingslab.com/press/itl-press-2009-03.pdf">here</a>. Unless you're a chipset/BIOS engineer kind of person, I strongly recommend reading the press release first, before opening the slides.<br /><br />So, the "Ring -3 Rootkit" presentation is about vPro/AMT chipset compromises. The "Attacking Intel BIOS" presentation is about exploiting a heap overflow in BIOS environment in order to bypass reflashing protection, that otherwise allows only Intel-signed updates to be flashed.<br /><br />We will publish the code some time after get back from Vegas.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />ps. Let me remind my dear readers that all the files hosted on the ITL website are not digitally signed and are served over a plaintext connection (HTTP). In addition, the ITL's website is hosted on a 3rd party provider's server, on which we have totally no control (which is the reason why we don't buy an SSL certificate for the website). Never trust unsigned files that you download from the Internet. ITL cannot be liable for any damages caused by the files downloaded from our website, unless they are digitally signed.
