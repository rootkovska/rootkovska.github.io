<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>Today <a href="https://wiki.qubes-os.org/wiki/QubesDownloads">we're releasing</a> Qubes OS R2! I'm not gonna write about all the cool features in this release because you can find all this in <a href="https://wiki.qubes-os.org/">our wiki</a> and previous announcements (<a href="/2012/12/14/qubes-2-beta-1-with-initial-windows.html">R2-beta1</a>, <a href="/2013/02/28/qubes-2-beta-2-has-been-released.html">R2-beta2</a>, <a href="/2013/12/11/qubes-r2-beta-3-has-been-released.html">R2-beta3</a>, <a href="/2014/04/20/qubes-os-r2-rc1-has-been-released.html">R2-rc1</a>, and <a href="/2014/08/06/qubes-os-r2-rc2-debian-template-ssled.html">R2-rc2</a>). Suffice to say that we've come a long way over those 4+ years from a <a href="/2010/04/07/introducing-qubes-os.html">primitive proof of concept</a> to a powerful desktop OS which, I believe, it is today.<br /><br />One of the biggest difficulties we have been facing with Qubes since the very beginning, has been the amount of this extra, not-so-exciting, not directly security-related work, but so much needed to ensure things actually work. Yet, the line between what is, and what is not-security related, is sometimes very thin and one can easily cross it if not being careful.<br /><br />It's great that we're receiving more and more community contributions. This includes not only bug fixes, but also invaluable efforts related to <a href="https://wiki.qubes-os.org/wiki/UserDoc">documentation</a>, <a href="https://wiki.qubes-os.org/wiki/HCL">HCL maintenance</a>, as well as some really non-trivial new features (advanced backups support, Debian and Arch templates, TorVM, Whonix port, etc). Thanks! <br /><br />I'm also happy to announce that <span id="goog_1035536959"></span><a href="https://independent.academia.edu/CasparBowden">Caspar Bowden<span id="goog_1035536960"></span></a>, a well known privacy advocate, expert on EU data protection law, member of the board of Tor, former Microsoft Chief Privacy Adviser, etc, will be taking a role as Qubes Policy Adviser, helping us to make Qubes OS more suitable for a wider audience of people interested in privacy, and be liaising&nbsp; with other projects that would like to build privacy services with Qubes as a base.<br /><br />And there is still a lot in front of us. Using the obligatory car analogy, I would say Qubes OS is currently like a racing car that just went into production as a road vehicle: one hell of an engine under-the-hood, and powerful new technologies until now unavailable even for professional use, yet lacking leather interior with 12-speaker audio system, and still with a manual transmission... This is just the beginning for making security by isolation on the desktop as "driveable" as a [insert your fav make of German fine cars] :)<br /><br />Exciting stuff is coming next: the Release 3 (“<a href="/2013/03/21/introducing-qubes-odyssey-framework.html">Odyssey</a>”) and more, stay tuned!<br /><br />Thanks to <a href="https://wiki.qubes-os.org/wiki/QubesDevelopers">everyone</a> who has made Qubes OS possible, as well as all the upstream projects without which we would probably never even try this journey: Xen, Linux, Xorg, and many others!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0yOLNM-YXqs/VCWk3PrvYgI/AAAAAAAAAPE/AnXQpgxmjLY/s1600/qubes-logo-blue.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0yOLNM-YXqs/VCWk3PrvYgI/AAAAAAAAAPE/AnXQpgxmjLY/s1600/qubes-logo-blue.png" height="200" width="200" /></a></div><br />
