It seems that <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/it/07/02/13/1922237.shtml">many people</a> didn’t fully understand why I wrote the previous post – <a href="/2007/02/12/vista-security-model-big-joke.html">Vista Security Model – A Big Joke</a>... There are two things which should be distinguished:<br /><br />1) The fact that UAC <b>design</b> assumes that every setup executable should be run elevated (and that a user doesn't really have a <b>choice</b> to run it from a non-elevated account),<br /><br />2) The fact that UAC <b>implementation</b> contains bug(s), like e.g. the bug I pointed out in my <a href="/2007/02/04/running-vista-every-day.html">article</a>, which allows a low integrity level process to send WM_KEYDOWN messages to a command prompt window running at high integrity level.<br /><br />I was pissed off not because of #1, but because Microsoft employee - Mark Russinovich - <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/markrussinovich/archive/2007/02/12/638372.aspx">declared  </a> that all <b>implementation</b> bugs in UAC are not to be considered as security bugs.<br /><br />True, I also don't like the fact that UAC forces users to run every setup program with elevated privileges (fact #1), but I can understand such a design decision (as being a compromise between usability and security) and this was <b>not</b> the reason why I wrote "The Joke Post".
