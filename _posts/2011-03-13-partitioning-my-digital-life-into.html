<span style="color: #333333;">The diagram below illustrates how I have decomposed my digital life into security domains. This is a quite sophisticated scheme and most users would probably want something simpler, but I think it's still interesting to discuss it. The domains are implemented as lightweight AppVMs on Qubes OS. The diagram also shows what type of networking connectivity each domain is allowed.</span><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IJVsMCGYQak/TXypnudUSjI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/o0OUQhixsPs/s1600/qubes%2Bpartitioning%2B-%2Bno%2Bflows.jpg" style="color: #333333;"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5583524137983560242" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IJVsMCGYQak/TXypnudUSjI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/o0OUQhixsPs/s400/qubes%2Bpartitioning%2B-%2Bno%2Bflows.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 300px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 400px;" /></a>          <style type="text/css">p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } </style><br /><span style="color: #333333;">Let's discuss this diagram bit by bit. The three basic domains are </span><b style="color: #333333;">work</b><span style="color: #333333; font-weight: normal;"> (the green label)</span><i style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">, </span></i><span style="color: #333333; font-style: normal;"><b>personal</b><span style="font-weight: normal;"> (the yellow label), and </span><b>red</b><span style="font-weight: normal;"> (for doing all the untrusted, insensitive things) – these are marked on the diagram with bold frames.</span></span><br /><br /><style type="text/css">p { margin-bottom: 0 </style><span style="color: #333333; font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">A quick digression on domain labels (colors) – in Qubes OS each domain, apart form having a distinct name, is also assigned a </span></span><i style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">label</span></i><span style="color: #333333; font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">, which basically is one of the several per-defined colors. These colors, which are used for drawing window decorations by the trusted Window Manager (color frames), are supposed to be user friendly, easy noticeable, indicators of how trusted a given window is. It's totally up to the user how he or she interprets these colors. For me, it has been somehow obvious to associate the </span></span><i style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">red</span></i><span style="color: #333333; font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> color with something that is untrusted and dangerous (the “red light” -- stop! danger!), </span></span><i style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">green </span></i><span style="color: #333333; font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">with something that is safe and trusted, while </span></span><i style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">yellow </span></i><span style="color: #333333; font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">and </span></span><i style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">orange</span></i><span style="color: #333333; font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> with something in the middle. I have also extended this scheme, to also include </span></span><i style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">blue</span></i><span style="color: #333333; font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">, and </span></span><i style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">black</span></i><span style="color: #333333; font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">, which I interpret as indicating progressively more trusted domains than green, with black being something  ultimately trusted.</span></span> <br /><div style="color: #333333;"><br /><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Back to my domains: the </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>work</b></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> domain is where I have access to my work email, where I keep my work PGP keys, where I prepare reports, slides, papers, etc. I also keep various contracts and NDAs here (yes, these are PDFs, but received from trusted parties via encrypted and signed email – otherwise I open them in </span></span><a href="/2010/06/01/disposable-vms.html"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% transparent;">Disposable VMs</span></span></span></a><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">). The </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>work</b></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> domain has only network access to my work email server (SMTP/IMAP4 over SSL), and nothing more.</span></span></div><div style="color: #333333;"><br /><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">For other work-related tasks that require some Web access, such as editing Qubes Wiki, or accepting LinkedIn invites, or downloading cool pictures from fotolia.com for my presentations, or specs and manuals from intel.com, for all this I use </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>work-pub</b></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> domain, which I have assigned the yellow label, meaning I consider it only somehow trusted, and I would certainly never put my PGP keys there, or any work-related confidential information.</span></span></div><div style="color: #333333;"><br /><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>personal</b></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> domain</span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b> </b></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">is where all my non-work related stuff, such as  personal email and calendar, holiday photos, videos, etc, are held. It doesn't really have access to the Web, but if I was into social networking I would then probably allow HTTPS to something like Facebook.</span></span></div><div style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Being somehow on the paranoid side, I also have a special </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>very-personal</b></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> domain, which I use for the communication with my partner when I'm away from home. We use PGP, of course, and I have a separate PGP keys for this purpose. While we don't discuss any </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% transparent;">secret and sensitive stuff</span></span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> there, we still prefer to keep our intimate conversations private.</span></span></div><div style="color: #333333;"><br /><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I use </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>shopping</b></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> for accessing all the internet e-commerce sites. Basically what defines this domain is access to my credit card numbers and my personal address (for shipping). Because I don't really have a dedicated “corporate” credit card, I do all the shopping in this domain, from groceries, through sports equipment, on hotel/plane reservations ending. If I had separate business credit cards, then I would probably split my </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>shopping</b></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> domain into </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>personal-shopping</b></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> and </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>work-shopping</b></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">. I also have </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>banking</b></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> domain, which I use only for managing my bank account (which again combines both my personal and company accounts).</span></span></div><div style="color: #333333;"><br /><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I also have a few specialized work-related domains, that I rarely use. The </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>work-admin</b></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> domain is used to manage almost all of the ITL servers, such as our webserver, Qubes repo &amp; wiki servers, email server and DNS management, etc. This domain is allowed only SSH traffic to those server, and HTTPS to a few Web-based management servers. The </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>work-blog</b></span><i><span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span></i><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">is used to manage this very blog you're reading now. The reason why it is separate from </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>work-admin</b></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> or </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>work</b></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">, is because I'm over paranoid, and because I fear that if somebody compromises the blogger service, and subsequently exploits a bug in my browser that I use for editing my blog, than I don't want this person to be able to also get admin access to all the ITL servers.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Similarly, if somebody somehow compromised e.g. the Amazon Web Management Console, and then exploited my browser in </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>work-admin</b></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">, then I would like at least to retain access to my blog. If I used twitter, I would probably also manage it from this </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>work-blog</b></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> domain, unless it was a personal twitter account, in which case I would run it from </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>personal</b></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">.</span></span></div><div style="color: #333333;"><br /><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>qubes-dev</b></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> domain is used for all the Qubes development, merging other developers' branches (after I verify signatures on their tags, of course!), building RPMs/ISOs (yes, Qubes Beta 1 will ship as a DVD ISO!), and finally signing them. Because the signing keys are there, this domain is very sensitive. This domain is allowed only SSH network access to our Qubes git server. Again, even if somebody compromised this Git server, it still would not be a big problem for us, because we sign and verify all the tags in each others repos (unless somebody could also modify the SSH/Git daemons running there so that they subsequently exploit a hypothetical bug in my git client software when I connect to the server).</span></span></div><div style="color: #333333;"><br /><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I also decided to keep all the accounting-related stuff in a separate domain – whenever I get an invoice I copy it to the </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>accounting</b></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> domain. The rationale for this is that I trust those PDFs much less than I trust the PDFs I keep in my </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>work</b></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> domain.<br /></span></span></div><div style="color: #333333;"><br /><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Once a year I move the old stuff from my </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>work</b></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> domain, such as old email spools, old contracts and NDAs, to the </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>work-archives</b></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> domain. This is to minimize the potential impact of the potential  attack on my </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>work</b></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> domain (my work domain could be attacked e.g. by exploiting a hypothetical bug in Thunderbird's protocol handshake using a MITM attack, or a hypothetical bug in GPG).</span></span></div><div style="color: #333333;"><br /><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>vault</b></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> domain is an ultimately trusted one where I generate and keep all my passwords (using keepass) and master GPG keys. Of course, this vault domain has no networking access. Most of those passwords, such as the email server access password is also kept in the specific domains which uses them, such as the </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>work </b></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">domain, and more specifically in the Thunderbird client (there is absolutely no point in not allowing e.g. Thunderbird to remember the password – if it got compromised it would just steal it the next time I manually enter it)</span></span></div><div style="color: #333333;"><br /><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">And finally, there is the previously mentioned </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>red</b></span><i><b> </b></i><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">domain (I have tried to call it </span></span><i><span style="font-weight: normal;">junk</span></i><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> or </span></span><i><span style="font-weight: normal;">random</span></i><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> in the past</span></span><i><span style="font-weight: normal;">, </span></i><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">but I think </span></span><i><span style="font-weight: normal;">red</span></i><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> is still a better name after all). The </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>red </b></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">domain is totally untrusted – if it gets compromised, I don't care – I would just recreate it within seconds. I don't even back it up! Basically I do there everything that doesn't fit into other domains, and which doesn't require me to provide any sensitive information. I don't differentiate between work-related and personal-related surfing even – I don't care about anonymity for all those tasks I do there. If I was concerned about anonymity, I would create a separate </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>anonymous</b></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> domain, and proxy all the traffic through a </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><b>tor proxy </b></span><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">from there.</span></span></div><div style="color: #333333; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% transparent;">Now, this all looks nice and easy ;) but there is one thing that complicates the above picture...</span></div><div style="color: #333333; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><style type="text/css">p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } </style>  </div><div style="font-style: normal;"><br /><span style="font-size: 100%;"><b><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% transparent;">Data flows between the domains</span></b></span></div><div style="font-style: normal;"><style type="text/css">p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } </style>  </div><div style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% transparent;">The diagram below shows the same domains, but additionally with arrows symbolizing typical data flows between them.</span></div><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6iEN6AFqWMU/TXyqaqgbtZI/AAAAAAAAAHY/FScd_uk9uso/s1600/qubes%2Bpartitioning%2B-%2Bdata%2Bflows.jpg" style="color: #333333;"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5583525013096215954" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6iEN6AFqWMU/TXyqaqgbtZI/AAAAAAAAAHY/FScd_uk9uso/s400/qubes%2Bpartitioning%2B-%2Bdata%2Bflows.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 300px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 400px;" /></a>          <style type="text/css">p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } </style>  <br /><div style="color: #333333; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% transparent;">You can see that most of the usual data flows are from <i>more trusted</i> domains to <i>less trusted</i> domains – e.g. copy and pasting a URL that I receive via email in my <b>work</b> domain, so that I could open it in my untrusted browser in <b>red</b>, or moving invoices from my <b>work</b><i><b> </b></i>domain (where I receive them via email) to the <b>accounting</b> domain.</span></div><div style="color: #333333; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% transparent;">But there are, unfortunately, also some transfers from <i>less trusted</i> domains to <i>more trusted</i> ones. One example is copy and pasting an interesting URL that I just stumbled upon when surfing in the <b>red</b> domain, and that I would like to share with a college at work, or a friend, and so I need to copy and paste it to my email client in either <b>work</b> (colleague) or <b>personal</b> (friend) domain.</span></div><div style="color: #333333; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% transparent;">Now, copying data from <i>less trusted</i> domains to <i>more trusted</i> ones presents a significant problem. While one could think that pasting an URL into Thunderbird email editor is a pretty harmless operation, it's still is an untrusted input – and we don't really know what the <b>red</b> domain <i>really </i>pasted into its local clipboard, and so what we will paste into the <b>work </b>domain's<b> </b>Thunderbird email editor (perhaps 64kB of some junk that will overflow some undo buffer in the editor?). And even more scary is the example with copying the cool-looking graphics file from the Web into my <b>work</b> domain so that I could use it in my presentation slides (e.g. an xkcd . Attacks originating through malicious JPEGs or other graphics format, and exploiting bugs in rendering code have been <a href="http://www.openwall.com/advisories/OW-002-netscape-jpeg/OW-002-netscape-jpeg.txt">known for more than a decade</a>.</span></div><div style="color: #333333; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% transparent;">But this problem – how to handle data flows from less trusted systems to more trusted ones – is not easily solvable in practice, unfortunately... </span> </div><div style="color: #333333; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% transparent;">Some people who design and build high-security systems for use by military and government takes a somehow opposite approach – they say they are not concerned about less-trusted-to-more-trusted data transfers as long as they could assure there is no way to perform a transfer in the opposite direction.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% transparent;">So, if we could build a system that guarantees that a more trusted domain can never transfer data to a less trusted domain (even if both of those domains are compromised!), then they are happy to allow one-way “up transfers”. In practice this means we need to eliminate all the covert channels between two <i>cooperating</i> domains. The word <i>cooperating</i> is a key word here, and which makes this whole idea not practical at all, IMHO.</span></div><div style="color: #333333; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% transparent;">Elimination of the covert channels between <i>cooperating</i> domains is indeed required in this scheme, because the assumption is that the data transfer from the less trusted domain could have indeed compromised the more trusted domain. But this, at least, should not result in any data leak back to the originating domain, and later to the less-classified network, which this less-trusted domain is presumably connected to. One of the assumptions here is that the user of such a system is connected to more than one, isolated networks. Even in that case, elimination of all the covert channels between domains (or at least minimizing their bandwith to something unusable – what is unusable, really?) is a big challenge, and can probably only could be done when we're ready to significantly sacrifice the system's performance (smart scheduling tricks are needed to minimize temporal covert channels).</span></div><div style="color: #333333; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% transparent;">I would like to make it clear that we are not interested in eliminating cooperative covert channels between domains in Qubes any time in the near future, and perhaps in the long term as well. I just don't believe into such approach, and I also don't like that this approach does nothing to preserve the <i>integrity</i> of the more-trusted domain – it only focuses on the isolation aspect. So, perhaps the attacker might not be able to leak secrets back to the less trusted domain, but he or she can do everything else in this more trusted domain. What good is isolation, if we don't maintain integrity?</span></div><div style="color: #333333; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% transparent;">An alternative solution to handling the less-trusted-to-more-trusted data transfers, is to have trusted “converters” or “verifiers” that could handle specific file types, such as JPEGs, and ensure we get a non-malicious file in the destination domain. While this might remind the bad-old A/V technology, it is something different. Here, the trusted converters would likely be some programs written in a safe language, running in another trusted domain, rather than a big ugly A/V with a huge database of signatures of “bad” patterns of what might appear in a JPEG file. The obvious problem with such an approach is that somebody must write those converters, and write them for all file types that we wish to allow to be transferred to more trusted domains. Perhaps doable in the longer-term, and perhaps we will do it in some future version of Qubes... </span> </div><div style="color: #333333; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% transparent;">Right now we are ignoring this problem, and we say that all less-trusted-to-more-trusted transfers are to be done on the user's own risk :) You're welcome to submit trusted converters for your favorite file type(s) in the meantime!</span></div><style type="text/css">p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } </style>  <br /><div style="color: #333333; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none;"><br /><span style="font-size: 100%;"><b><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% transparent;">Copying files between domains</span></b></span></div><style type="text/css">p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } </style>  <br /><div style="color: #333333; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;"><br /><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% transparent;">Speaking of copying files between domains, there is another security catch here. If we imagined two physically separated machines that share no common network resources, the only way to move files between those two air-gaped machines would be via something like a USB stick or a CDROM or DVD disc. But inserting a USB drive or CDROM into a machine triggers a whole lot of actions: from parsing device-provided information, loading required drivers (for USB), parsing the driver's partition table, mounting and finally parsing the filesystem. Each of this stage requires the machine's OS to perform a lot of untrusted input processing, and the potential attack space here is quite large. So, even if we could limit ourselves to copy only harmless files between machines/domains (perhaps they were somehow verified by a trusted party in-between, as discussed above), still there is a huge opportunity that the originating domain could compromise the target domain.</span></div><div style="color: #333333; font-style: normal;"><br />In Qubes Alpha we have been using a similar file copy mechanism, using a virtual stick for file copy between domains. In Qubes Beta 1 we will provide a new scheme based on same shared memory channel that we use for GUI virtualization – the technical details of this solution will be available soon in <a href="http://wiki.qubes-os.org/trac">our wiki</a>. The most sensitive element in this new scheme is the un-cpio-like utility that runs in the target domain and unpacks the incoming blob into the pre-defined directory tree (e.g. <span style="font-family: courier new;">/home/user/incoming/from-{domainname}/</span>). We believe we can write pretty safe un-cpio-like utility, in contrast to secure all the previously mentioned elements (USB device parsing, partition parsing, fs parsing). The Qubes Beta 1 is planned to be released at the end of March, BTW.</div><div style="color: #333333; font-style: normal;"><br /><span style="font-size: 100%; font-weight: bold;">Partitioning enforcement and easy of use</span></div><div style="color: #333333; font-style: normal;"><br /><span style="color: #333333;">For any security partitioning scheme to make sense in real life, it is necessary to have some enforcement mechanism that would ensure that the </span><span style="color: #333333; font-style: italic;">user</span><span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span></span><span style="color: #333333;">doesn't mistakenly bypass it. Specifically for this purpose we have come up with special, previously-mentioned firewalling support in Qubes</span><span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="color: #333333;">Beta 1</span><span style="color: #333333;">,</span><span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="color: #333333;">that I will cover in a separate article soon.</span></div><br /><span style="color: #333333;">Anther thing is to make the partitioning easy to use. For instance, I would like to be able to setup a </span><span style="color: #333333;">hint</span><span style="color: #333333; font-style: italic;"> </span><span style="color: #333333;">in the policy, that when I click on an URL in an email I received in my </span><span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">work</span><span style="color: #333333;"> domain that it should be automatically opened in the </span><span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;">red</span> domain's default Web browser.<span style="color: #333333;"> Currently we don't do that in Qubes, but we're thinking about doing it in the near future.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #333333; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 100%;">Summary</span><br /><br /></span><span style="color: #333333;">Partitioning one's di</span><span style="color: #333333;">gital life into security domains is certainly not an easy process and requires some thinking. This process is also very user-specific. The partitioning scheme that I've come up for myself is quite sophisticated, and most people would probably want something much simpler. In case of corporate deployments, the scheme would be designed by CIO or IT admins, and enforced on users automatically. Much bigger problem are home and small business users, who would need to come up with the partitioning themselves.
