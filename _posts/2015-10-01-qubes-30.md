title: Qubes 3.0

About 5 months after the initial release of [Qubes 3.0-rc1](http://blog.invisiblethings.org/2015/04/23/qubes-30rc1-and-roadmap.html), we're
now releasing the final 3.0 today!

Let me quickly recap the main "killer features" of Qubes OS 3.0 compared to the
Release 2:

* Qubes is now based on what we call [Hypervisor Abstraction Layer
  (HAL)](http://blog.invisiblethings.org/2013/03/21/introducing-qubes-odyssey-framework.html),
  which decouples Qubes logic from the underlying hypervisor. This will allow us
  to easily switch the underlying hypervisors in the near future, perhaps even
  during the installation time, depending on the user needs (think tradeoffs
  between hardware compatibility and performance vs. security properties
  desired, such as e.g.  reduction of covert channels between VMs, which might
  be of importance to some users). More philosophically-wise, this is a nice
  manifestation of how Qubes OS is really "not yet another virtualization
  system", but rather: a user of a virtualization system (such as Xen).

* We upgraded from Xen 4.1 to Xen 4.4 (now that was really easy thanks to HAL),
  which allowed for: 1) better hardware compatibility (e.g. UEFI coming soon in
  3.1), 2) better performance (e.g. via Xen's libvchan that replaced our vchan).
  Also, new Qubes qrexec framework that has optimized performance for inter-VM
  services.

* We introduced officially supported [Debian
  templates](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/Templates/Debian/).

* And finally: we integrated [Whonix
  templates](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Qubes), which optimize Tor workflows
  for Qubes.

As explained in our [Release Cycle
Documentation](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/VersionScheme/) (something we
finally created and been polishing through this 3.0 branch development), there
is almost no new features in 3.0 compared to 3.0-rc1, essentially only
[bugfixes](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Release+3.0%22+is%3Aclosed),
intermixed with a few minor improvements.

But, while the 3.0 branch was "maturing", and getting bugfixes merged, most of
our work has been focused on the 3.1 branch, which is adding a bunch of
exciting new features, as indicated on our high-level
[roadmap](https://github.com/rootkovska/qubes-roadmap), specifically:

1. UEFI support (see this
   [ticket](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/794) for more info
   and test images).

2. Live USB edition (preview for which we already
   [released](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/qubes-users/IQdCEpkooto/iyMh3LuzCAAJ)
   earlier this summer, now it will get merged into the master branch for 3.1)

3. Management/pre-configuration stack: The Big Killer Feature of the upcoming
   3.1 release, which will make it easy to provide out of the box configurations
   for things such as: out of the box Whonix/Tor, or Split GPG, or default USB
   sandboxing VM, which currently the user must do manually.

We're planning to release the first candidate for 3.1 as early as the end of
October, actually.

But development of any serious project is not just adding new features, although
that's admittedly the most exciting thing for any developer to do. In
R3 we have finally started implementing this golden thought, and the first
tangible outcome of this change of attitude is the automated testing framework
which we have been using for all the releases in this 3.0 branch already. We
hope this results in much more polished, stable code.

Other things we've started to be increasingly prioritizing recently, and only
plan to intensify in the coming year are: 1) making Qubes more accessible to
people (think easier to get hardware that can run Qubes OS), and 2) easier to
use (better UX and UI). I think this is also pretty exciting, actually.

As [previously
announced](http://blog.invisiblethings.org/2015/07/10/caspar.html) earlier this
summer, we have decided to dedicate this release of Qubes OS to the memory of
[Caspar Bowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspar_Bowden):

Caspar has been a proud user, supporter, and advocate for Qubes OS, and also a
friend. I think he would have liked that dedication.

The Qubes 3.0 ISO can be downloaded from
[here](https://www.qubes-os.org/downloads/).

We have also released another scheduled [Qubes
Canary](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-secpack/blob/master/canaries/canary-005-2015.txt)
today.

I would like to thank all the [people](https://www.qubes-os.org/people/) who
have contributed to this huge effort of creating a new "reasonably secure"
desktop OS. I believe we're making together an important and meaningful thing
here. Let's keep this going!
