title: "I have a new blog: Traces of Humanity!"
author: Joanna Rutkowska

Hello! Welcome back! After all those years of silence, I’ve felt like writing a blog again :-)

But these days I no longer do computer security -- other topics interest me more now. Thus, I have spun up a new blog titled: [Traces of Humanity](https://tracesofhumanity.org).

It is mainly intended to be a reportage of my struggles between Rationality and Humanism. Plus a place to discuss some of my new projects :-) I discuss this more in the short [intro post](https://tracesofhumanity.org/hello-world/).

You can follow using your favorite RSS client, or -- new for this edition! -- as an email-based newsletter.

See you there!
joanna.
